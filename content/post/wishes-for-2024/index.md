3 months after moving to Japan, sometimes I have to confront the darkness inside of myself.

- Sice I always mess my bioclock up and it gets me tired, **I need to learn how to lead a life, how to arrange my time properly and how to sleep.**

- **My next turn for the visa should be certain.** I started my plan when I think I would go for a university but now the story has changed. If it is the best chance for me to have a work visa, I can't find any reason for not doing so. However, the price for it is also a lot. Getting rejected and I have to complete a degree here, maybe there.

- **The NIW thing should be progressing well.** It's a giant breakthrough for me that the EB2-NIW perhaps to be working for me. I am doing publications with my collegues, and I think maybe I will be eligible for it in 6 months.

- **Watch more movies.** I have switched from reading books to watching movies for a long time. Admissions for me are that movie is a kind of more advanced experience than reading books and it consumes less time.

- **Learn German.** If it ends up that I have to go to a university, I will pick Germany for the ideal place. Though there're some English programs available for a Bachelor's, most of the programs are given in German. If possible, I hope I can understand basic German this year, and gain a proficiency of B2 will be the final goal till April, 2025.

After all, everything will be changing since this year, and it will make all the differences for the next 4 years for me. Let me have a cup of tea, keeping my eye closed and wait for the echo turning back.
