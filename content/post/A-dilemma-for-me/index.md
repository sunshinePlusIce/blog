Had a phone call with a HR in BASE, a Chinese SES company in Japan which is known for its strict degree filter. 

A gentle lady talked to me for about 30 minutes and for the last 15 minutes she said,

"I think I can give you some advice personally"

I didn't say anything, just nodding, she couldn't see it, though.

"I suggest that you should go to a university. If you were not a successful candidate for our company, I think it's a good option for you to get into a university, and after graduation, you will bejust 26, 27 years old, that's not too late, isn't it?"

Actually I have not made my mind. My education is not going good after 2020 when I was graduated from my high school.
