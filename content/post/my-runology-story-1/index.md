## Beforehand

After more than one year's work in Runology, I managed to get out of my country to move to Japan. Many things had happened and I met many people who are willing to offer help or who leaves me deep impression.

I noticed some of these things have the value to be recorded and to be put in a corner of the Internet. It's like a seed held by a sailer who is voyaging over the ocean. Why not put the seed into a bottle and let it go to an island in which there's hope?

And these kinds of records are also a history, which can never be forgotten.

## My Background

I in my 18 took the University Entrance Exam and was admitted to a university in China in 2020. Unfortunately, I decided to quit the school in 2021, after one year's learning at that school.

That was in 2021, I, only 19 years old, didn't know what to do. 1 year later, I took the exam again and got into another school in 2022.

That was a hard time, when most of the cities in China were under crazy lockdown. People were not allowed to go out, not allowed to stay in their own house whenever they are just likely to be infected by the virus, and also not allowed to run away out of their house like a rat when there's a fire breaking out.

Finally I woke up from my daydream, I found the reason why all of these could happen, it is not because of the virus, the cvoid or something naturally, it's because of them, those who are ruling this country. They can play on this country like a rolling a dice, ignoring the burning anger of the people.

I have become a active member of Runology since 2022. I am not grewing up as a `Pinky`(Those who support the goverment no matter what they have done), though, especially find the GFW annoying since a `ladder`(VPN) is always needed to access the document I want when I am playing with code. I knew something that they killed many students in Tiananmen Square in 1989 with tanks and toxic gas. I thought that was nothing to do with me. They can't run a tank over a young man anymore in 21st century, I told to myself.

I want to become a teacher to teach History, English or Programming. That was what I'm thinking about since quitting the school, before messages came to me saying that Shanghai was locked down. Shanghai is a mega city, I travelled to there after graduation from high school in July, 2020. It's a giant city with massive population and it was frozen overnight.

I broke down losing my last bit of trust to this country. I decided to run(means escape), I found a man called `Nika` who is working as a nurse in Austrlia. His posts and comments were appealing and thanks to him I know there is a way to run out of this country with a lower price.

I threw away my books without hesitation, because somehow I know, it is right path I need to go. I browsed `Nika`'s posts day and night, and my exciting heart started to chill, Australia would not be the path for me, it costs much...
